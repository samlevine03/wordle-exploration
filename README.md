# Wordle in different programming languages

## About

This project aims to create a command-line version of the popular word game Wordle in multiple programming languages. The goal is to explore and understand the different programming paradigms, syntaxes, and unique features offered by each language. 

## Project Scope

### Languages

The project includes implementations in the following languages:

- **Object-Oriented and OOP-ish:** Java, C++, C#, Python, Ruby, PHP, TypeScript, JavaScript, Kotlin
- **Functional:** Haskell, OCaml, Elixir, F#, Clojure
- **Procedural:** C, Go, Rust
- **Scripting:** Python, Perl, Lua, Bash

### Repository Structure

- Each language implementation is contained in its respective directory.
- Common game design specifications are found in `DESIGNSPEC.md`.
- Individual READMEs in each directory provide specific details about running the application in that language.

## Getting Started

Each directory in this repository corresponds to a specific programming language. To get started with an implementation:

1. **Navigate** to the desired language directory.
2. **Read** the language-specific README for setup and execution instructions.
3. **Run** the Wordle game following the instructions.
